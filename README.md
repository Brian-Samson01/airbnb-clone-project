### 💭 Importance of Identifying Design Properties

Understanding the design properties in Figma—such as **color styles**, **typography**, and **component spacing**—is critical before starting the development process.

**Key Reasons:**
- 🎯 **Consistency:** Ensures a unified look and feel across all pages and components.  
- 🧩 **Efficiency:** Speeds up development by providing a reference for reusing visual patterns.  
- 🧠 **Clarity:** Helps developers understand the designer’s intent and visual hierarchy.  
- 📱 **Responsiveness:** Guides decisions on scaling and layout adjustments for different screen sizes.  
- ✅ **Quality Assurance:** Minimizes design–implementation mismatches and reduces revisions later.

By thoroughly analyzing the Figma mockup and documenting its design properties, the development team can build an application that remains faithful to the intended user experience.
